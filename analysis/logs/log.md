# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week 1 — March 28, 2025


### Number of hours: 
~22 hours

### Rose:
My highlight this week was writing the project summary and executive summary, which gave me the chance to clearly define the project's motivation, goals, and real-world application. Distilling our purpose—analyzing joke comments for educational engagement—into a compelling narrative was both fun and meaningful. I also enjoyed contributing to the revision planning and syncing with the team on timelines.

### Bud: 
I'm looking forward to tracking and analyzing audience engagement metrics, which is central to understanding how humor affects viewer interaction on educational content. I'm excited to begin designing the structure for the analysis report that will present these insights in a visually appealing and accessible format.

### Thorn: 
There was some ambiguity in balancing high-level documentation with detailed technical notes—especially in separating sentiment classification from joke classification in our reporting. I also found aligning the writing tone across team-written sections to be slightly time-consuming.

## Additional thought
Since I'm responsible for project documentation, engagement metrics, and reporting, I want to build a robust template early on that can be reused as we scale our analysis. Creating consistency and clarity in reporting will not only help with our final deliverables but also improve our team communication.
