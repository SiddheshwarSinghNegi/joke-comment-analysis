# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week 2 — April 4, 2025


### Number of hours: 
~23 hours

### Rose:
This week, I finalized and signed off on the proposal and milestone timeline, ensuring that our project phases are well defined and executable. I also contributed to refining the responsibility table, mapping out key deliverables per member. It felt great to help anchor the structure of the project while maintaining a balance between technical feasibility and academic goals.

### Bud: 
I’m eager to start working on engagement analysis logic, particularly measuring how joke comments correlate with video likes, views, and replies. I’m also enthusiastic about tackling the emoji and hashtag processing stretch goal, as it adds an exciting layer of nuance to humor detection.

### Thorn: 
We’re beginning to see how joke detection isn’t always straightforward, especially with sarcasm, slang, and cultural context involved. Integrating that understanding into our models will be tricky. Also, coordinating edits across the team has introduced minor version control friction during documentation.

## Additional thought
We're at a crucial moment—locking the scope now prevents feature creep later. I want to make sure that we keep the analysis tight and meaningful. A future version of this work could definitely evolve into a plugin or API for educational YouTubers. Need to keep track of that idea for potential post-course development.
