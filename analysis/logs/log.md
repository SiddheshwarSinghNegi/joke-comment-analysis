Rose:
My highlight this week was writing the project summary and executive summary, which gave me the chance to clearly define the project's motivation, goals, and real-world application. Distilling our purpose—analyzing joke comments for educational engagement—into a compelling narrative was both fun and meaningful. I also enjoyed contributing to the revision planning and syncing with the team on timelines.

Bud:
I'm looking forward to tracking and analyzing audience engagement metrics, which is central to understanding how humor affects viewer interaction on educational content. I'm excited to begin designing the structure for the analysis report that will present these insights in a visually appealing and accessible format.

Thorn:
There was some ambiguity in balancing high-level documentation with detailed technical notes—especially in separating sentiment classification from joke classification in our reporting. I also found aligning the writing tone across team-written sections to be slightly time-consuming.

Additional thought
Since I'm responsible for project documentation, engagement metrics, and reporting, I want to build a robust template early on that can be reused as we scale our analysis. Creating consistency and clarity in reporting will not only help with our final deliverables but also improve our team communication.

Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log
Date:
Week 2 — April 4, 2025

Number of hours:
~23 hours

Rose:
This week, I finalized and signed off on the proposal and milestone timeline, ensuring that our project phases are well defined and executable. I also contributed to refining the responsibility table, mapping out key deliverables per member. It felt great to help anchor the structure of the project while maintaining a balance between technical feasibility and academic goals.

Bud:
I’m eager to start working on engagement analysis logic, particularly measuring how joke comments correlate with video likes, views, and replies. I’m also enthusiastic about tackling the emoji and hashtag processing stretch goal, as it adds an exciting layer of nuance to humor detection.

Thorn:
We’re beginning to see how joke detection isn’t always straightforward, especially with sarcasm, slang, and cultural context involved. Integrating that understanding into our models will be tricky. Also, coordinating edits across the team has introduced minor version control friction during documentation.

Additional thought
We're at a crucial moment—locking the scope now prevents feature creep later. I want to make sure that we keep the analysis tight and meaningful. A future version of this work could definitely evolve into a plugin or API for educational YouTubers. Need to keep track of that idea for potential post-course development.
